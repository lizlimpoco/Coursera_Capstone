What was formerly the mindset of focusing on beautifying and advancing the capital of the country has now been changed into strengthening the other potentially progressive cities and municipalities. One such rising city in the south is Davao City.       \n  \n  > Those who have resided in Davao City for a long time can attest to the rapid developments taking place in the city. High-rise buildings and business establishments which have previously been rare are now appearing like mushrooms, not to mention the increase in traffic flow and congestion as more and more citizens are being financially capable of owning private vehicles. People from surrounding cities and municipalities swarm because of the education and job opportunities the city has to offer. For a business man who wants to invest and take advantage of the flourishing economy in this city, a good understanding of the existing venues (or lack thereof) spread all over the city would be a good starting point. Thus, this project aims to provide a geospatial analysis of the venue categories found in the barangays in Davao City. Specifically, the barangays will be clustered according to the venue categories in order to identify potential business ventures as well as the location of such.\n  \n> This project will provide valuable information to businessmen who want to determine which category of venue will be most promising for a particular area, considering the existing venues nearby. Furthermore, the results of the project may also help city planners identify barangays which can potentially cater to certain categories of venues, thereby contributing to strategic planning of new venues."

The list of barangays can be found in a Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Davao_City) which will be scraped through the BeautifulSoup package in Python. The barangays are grouped according to the district they are assigned to. There are 3 districts in Davao City, and each is subdivided according to district centers. For example, the 1st District has two centers: Poblacion with 40 barangays and Talomo with 14 barangays.  \n\n> The geographical coordinates of the barangays will be obtained through geocoder. Particularly, the latitude and longitude data per barangay will be retrieved. These coordinates will be used to determine 100 venues within a 500-meter radius per barangay. These venues can be retrieved from Foursquare. The venues and venue categories, as well as the geographical coordinates per venue will be included in the analysis. For instance, for Poblacion in the 1st District, one of the venues within its 500-meter radius is the famous \u201cRoxas Street Foods\u201d under the category \u201cBBQ Joint\u201d with latitude and longitude equal to 7.063038 and 125.611376, respectively. The barangays and the venues will then be mapped through Folium. \n"
